# Connections-of-all-patterns
Personal  templates of the connection of patterns for future projects
----------------------
- The central pattern is a linker with inherited leaf and compostor classes, the other 22 patterns interact with each other. 
- The main function contains all the functions with successful combinations that should be used in your projects. 
- All patterns are executed in the author's way (mine), but as I thought these are the most effective and popular combinations.
- I got the information by studying the book Band of Four - Design Patterns
